# HTML to QuerySelector
Automate your DOM selection! Select an HTML element, name your variable, and pick a JS/TS file—it generates a `querySelector` for you.

## Features
- Select HTML → Custom variable name → Insert in JS/TS file.
- Smart file picker with autocomplete.
- Stays in your current file for smooth workflow.

## Usage
1. Highlight an HTML element (e.g., `<div id="myDiv">`).
2. Run `Get HTML Selection` (or Ctrl+Shift+Q).
3. Name your variable.
4. Pick a JS/TS file if needed.

## Why?
Saves time, reduces typos, keeps you coding—not copying.
